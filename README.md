Hi, I'm Julien.

I work as a software engineer for [SumUp](https://sumup.com/).

As of January 2024, I work in the Data Platform, on the Streaming Infrastructure.

We are re-architecting Kafka and moving Data Platform from ETL to EL(T).

Hit me up if you want to talk at julien.limoges@sumup.com.

I have worked & supported projects in the realm of:
- Operations (e.g. incident response & management)
- Identity & Access Managment (e.g. users & accounts, logins, security, access control)
- Notifications (e.g. templating, emails, sms, push notifications, configurable traffic routing).
- Observability (e.g. prometheus, operators, programmatic grafana dashboards/panels)
- CICD (e.g. jenkins, argocd, github actions,)
- Traffic, Networking & Security (e.g. ingress/egress gateways, routing, dns & certificate management).
- Configuration Management (e.g. helm, jsonnet, terraform, operators, cuelang).
